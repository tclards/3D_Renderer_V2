I created this 3D renderer using C++, DirectX, and HLSL last year as part of a school project. I then spent significant time on my own upgrading and refining it. It was also used as the backbone of a school game project written entirely in C++ without an engine.

This project made use of a free-use 3rd party library called Gateware, developed and provided by professors at Full Sail University. I intend to finish removing this dependency eventually, as it is mostly used for matrix math (and a few draw functions) and I have created my own matrix math library to replace it with.
